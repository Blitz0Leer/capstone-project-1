  <ul>
    <li><h3>Summary</h3></li>
    <p>From the moment I stumbled into the world of programming as a script kiddie in seventh grade, I discovered a passion that would shape the course of my life. It was the early exposure to the magic of coding that ignited a spark within me, a spark that keeps me coming back for more. During my freshman year of high school, my drive for programming deepened as I wanted to master the foundational principles of this field of art that only a few can make beautiful.</p>

    <p>One of the most significant influences on my path has been my close friend Aiden. I introduced him to Python in the seventh grade. What followed was a journey where Aidenâ€™s passion grew deeper than mine, and he definitely has surpassed me in the back-end. Rather than me giving up, I use his accomplishments to serve as inspiration to continue my journey - a love for the art of design and the craftsmanship it takes to not only create functional but beautiful code.</p>

    <p>I am eager to contribute my dedication, creativity, and an unrelenting drive to perfect the craft of programming. My objective is to continue learning, push the boundaries of what is possible, and be a part of projects that take on the struggle to continue my journey.</p>

    <li><h3>My Education</h3></li>
    <p>I am a junior in high school.</p>

    <li><h3>Work Experience</h3></li>
